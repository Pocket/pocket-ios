/**
 * Welcome to YapDatabase!
 *
 * The project page has a wealth of documentation if you have any questions.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase
 *
 * If you're new to the project you may want to visit the wiki.
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki
 *
 * From a single YapDatabase instance you can create multiple connections.
 * Each connection is thread-safe and may be used concurrently with other connections.
 * 
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database.
 * Multiple connections can simultaneously read from the database while another connection is modifying the database.
 * For example, the main thread could be reading from the database via connection A,
 * while a background thread is writing to the database via connection B.
 *
 * However, only a single connection may be writing to the database at any one time.
 * This is an inherent limitation of the underlying sqlite database.
 *
 * A connection instance is thread-safe, and operates by serializing access to itself.
 * Thus you can share a single connection between multiple threads.
 * But for conncurrent access between multiple threads you must use multiple connections.

/**
 * When architecting your application, you will likely create a few dedicated connections for particular uses.
 * This property allows you to enforce only allowed transaction types for your dedicated connections.
 *
 * --- Example 1: ---
 *
 * You have a connection designed for use on the main thread which uses a longLivedReadTransaction.
 * Ideally this connection has the following constraints:
 * - May only be used on the main thread
 * - Can only be used for synchronous read transactions
 * 
 * The idea is to ensure that a read transaction on the main thread never blocks.
 * Thus you don't want background threads potentially tying up the connection.
 * Remember: transactions go through a serial per-connection queue.
 * And similarly, you don't want asynchronous operations of any kind. As that would be the equivalent of
 * using the connection on a background thread.
 * 
 * To enforce this, you can do something like this within your app:
 *
 * uiDatabaseConnection.permittedTransactions = YDB_SyncReadTransaction | YDB_MainThreadOnly;
 * [uiDatabaseConnection beginLongLivedReadTransaction];
 * 
 * --- Example 2: ---
 * 
 * You have a dedicated connection designed for read-only operations in background tasks.
 * And you want to make sure that no read-write transactions are accidentally invoked on this connection,
 * as that would slow your background tasks (which are designed to asynchronous, but generally very fast).
 * 
 * To enforce this, you can do something like this within your app:
 * 
 * roDatabaseConnection.permittedTransactions = YDB_AnyReadTransaction;
 * 
 * --- Example 3: ---
 * 
 * You have an internal databaseConnection within some highly asynchronous manager class.
 * You've designed just about every method to be asynchronous,
 * and you want to make sure you always remember to use asynchronous transactions.
 * 
 * So, for debugging purposes, you do something like this:
 * 
 * #if DEBUG
 * databaseConnection.permittedTransactions = YBD_AnyAsyncTransaction;
 * #endif
 *
 * 
 * The default value is YDB_AnyTransaction.

#pragma mark State
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/**
 * The snapshot number is the internal synchronization state primitive for the connection.
 * It's generally only useful for database internals,
 * but it can sometimes come in handy for general debugging of your app.
 *
 * The snapshot is a simple 64-bit number that gets incremented upon every readwrite transaction
 * that makes modifications to the database. Due to the concurrent architecture of YapDatabase,
 * there may be multiple concurrent connections that are inspecting the database at similar times,
 * yet they are looking at slightly different "snapshots" of the database.
 * 
 * The snapshot number may thus be inspected to determine (in a general fashion) what state the connection
 * is in compared with other connections.
 * 
 * You may also query YapDatabase.snapshot to determine the most up-to-date snapshot among all connections.
 *
 * Example:
 * 
 * YapDatabase *database = [[YapDatabase alloc] init...];
 * database.snapshot; // returns zero
 *
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection1 = [database newConnection];
 * YapDatabaseConnection *connection2 = [database newConnection];
 * 
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns zero
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns zero
 * 
 * [connection1 readWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectA forKey:keyA];
 * }];
 * 
 * database.snapshot;    // returns 1
 * connection1.snapshot; // returns 1
 * connection2.snapshot; // returns 1
 * 
 * [connection1 asyncReadWriteWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadWriteTransaction *transaction){
 *     [transaction setObject:objectB forKey:keyB];
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0]; // sleep for 1 second
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 1 (we know it will turn into 2 once the transaction completes)
 * } completion:^{
 *     
 *     connection1.snapshot; // returns 2
 * }];
 * 
 * [connection2 asyncReadWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadTransaction *transaction){
 *     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5.0]; // sleep for 5 seconds
 * 
 *     connection2.snapshot; // returns 1. See why?
 * }];
 *
 * It's because connection2 started its transaction when the database was in snapshot 1.
 * Thus, for the duration of its transaction, the database remains in that state.
 * 
 * However, once connection2 completes its transaction, it will automatically update itself to snapshot 2.
 *
 * In general, the snapshot is primarily for internal use.
 * However, it may come in handy for some tricky edge-case bugs
 * (i.e. why doesn't my connection see that other commit ?)
**/

/**
 * Returns the number of pending/active transactions for the connection.
 * That is, the number of queued read-only & read-write transactions that are
 * currently queued to be performed on this connection.
 *
 * Note that if a transaction is currently in progress (active),
 * it's still considered "pending" since it hasn't completed yet.
 *
 * This is a generalized way to estimate the load on a connection,

 * And thus if you have an app that was using YapDatabase prior to this version,
 * then the existing database file will continue to operate in "auto_vacuum=NONE" mode.
 * This means the existing database file won't be properly truncated as you delete information from the db.
 * That is, the data will be removed, but the pages will be moved to the freelist,
 * and the file itself will remain the same size on disk. (I.e. the file size can grow, but not shrink.)
 * To correct this problem, you should run the vacuum operation at least once.
 * After it is run, the "auto_vacuum=FULL" mode will be set,
 * and the database file size will automatically shrink in the future (as you delete data).
 * 
 * @returns Result from "PRAGMA auto_vacuum;" command, as a readable string:
 *   - NONE
 *   - FULL
 *   - INCREMENTAL
 *   - UNKNOWN (future proofing)
 * 
 * If the return value is NONE, then you should run the vacuum operation at some point
 * in order to properly reconfigure the database.
 *
 * Concerning Method Invocation:
 *
 * You can invoke this method as a standalone method on the connection:
 * 
 *   NSString *value = [databaseConnection pragmaAutoVacuum]
 * 
 * Or you can invoke this method within a transaction:
 *
 * [databaseConnection asyncReadWithBlock:^(YapDatabaseReadTransaction *transaction){
 *     NSString *value = [databaseConnection pragmaAutoVacuum];
 * }];
