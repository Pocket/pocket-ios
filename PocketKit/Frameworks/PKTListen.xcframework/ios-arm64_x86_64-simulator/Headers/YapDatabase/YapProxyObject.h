 * YapProxyObject acts as a proxy for a real object in order to lazily load the object on demand.

 * Generally, a YapProxyObject will be passed via a block parameter.
 * The underlying object that the proxy represents may or may not be loaded in memory.
 * If not, the proxy is configured to automatically load the underlying object
