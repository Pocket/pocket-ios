/**
 * A bidirectional cache has the following features:
 *
 * - stores <key, value> pairs
 * - supports a single value per key
 * - supports a single key per value
 * - efficient mapping from key to value
 * - efficient mapping from value to key
 * - optional strict cache size
 * - eviction based on least-recently-used
 *
 * The cache maintains two dictionaries internally.
 * One mapping from key to value.
 * And the other mapping from value to key.
 * So a lookup based on the either the key or value can be performed in O(1).
 *
 * Caching:
 *
 * When the countLimit is non-zero,
 *   this class operates as a cache, enforcing the designed limit, and using eviction when the limit is exceeded.
 * When the countLimit is zero,
 *   this class operates as a generic container (with no limit, and no automatic eviction).
 *
 * Eviction depends entirely on usage.
 * The cache maintains a doubly linked-list of tuples ordered by access.
 * The most recently accessed item is at the front of the linked-list,
 * and the least recently accessed item is at the back.
 * So it's very quick and efficient to evict items based on recent usage.
